## What is kanban

![Kanban](/assets/images/collection/kanban.jpg)

A **scheduling system** limits the buildup of excess inventory at any point in production. **Problem areas** are highlighted by measuring lead time and cycle time of the full process and process steps.

### Some benefits

- **Visual management** relies on visual boards that depict the workflow and the status of each work item providing transparency, and the current state of tasks, bottlenecks.
- **Work items** are typically small and are completed as they move through the workflow, allowing for quicker value delivery.
- **Efficient resource utilization** identifies bottlenecks and allocate resources more effectively that makes decisions about how to best complete their work. This empowerment can lead to increased engagement and ownership among team members.
- **Metrics-driven improvement** relies on data and metrics to drive improvement efforts.

### Some drawbacks

- **Lack of structure** might lead to confusion or inefficiency.
- **Risk of over-optimization** can sometimes lead to micro-optimizations at the expense of larger process improvements. Teams might focus on reducing bottlenecks without addressing underlying issues.
- Requires **high level of discipline** makes teams need to maintain a high level of discipline to ensure that work flows smoothly and that the Kanban board accurately represents the current state of tasks.
- **Dependence on strong team communication** relies heavily on team members communicating and collaborating effectively.

## Principles

- **Visualizing** work with *time-boxing* techniques.
- Limiting **work in progress**.
- Managing flow.
- Making process policies explicit.

## Components

- **Kanban board** is a visual representation of the workflow divided into columns that represent different stages or steps in the work process.
- **Columns** represent the stages or states that work items pass through. These could include stages like "To Do", "In Progress", "Testing", and "Done".
- **Work items** are represented by cards on the Kanban board. Each card represents a task, feature, or user story. Work items are moved across columns to visually indicate their progress.
- **Work-In-Progress (WIP)** limits are set for each column to control the number of work items that can be in progress at any given time. WIP limits prevent overloading the team and help maintain a smooth flow of work.
- **Swimlanes** are horizontal sections on the Kanban board that can be used to group work items by different categories: priority levels, or types of work, ...
- **Visual signals** are often used to indicate the status of work items including color-coded cards, icons, or other visual cues to represent different types of work, urgency, or other relevant information.
- **Pull-based system** means that new work is pulled into the system only when there's available capacity to handle it. This prevents overloading the team and ensures a more manageable workflow.
- **Continuous improvement** analyzes their workflow, identify bottlenecks, and make incremental changes to optimize their processes.
- **Feedback loops** address issues and gather insights to help the team discuss work in progress, upcoming work, and potential improvements.
- **Explicit policies** promotes the use for each column defined the criteria that must be met for a work item to move from one column to the next, ensure consistent workflow management.
- **Metrics and analytics** includes cycle time (how long it takes for a work item to move through the workflow) and lead time (total time from request to completion).
- **Service level agreements (SLAs)** can be used to define the expected timeframes for work items to move through specific stages.
