## Traditional approach

**Waterfall** is old traditional methodology (**linear progression** from beginning to end) to develope products because it is easy to use but there is still some drawbacks:

- *Less flexible* making projects slower if having any changes in process.
- Need *clear requests/constraints/timeline* from clients.

## What is agile

The **iterative** and **people-centric** approach prioritizes *quick delivery*, adapting to change, and collaboration rather than **top-down management** and following a set plan being carried out in *short-term development* cycles.

If a project doesn’t have clear constraints, timelines, or available resources, it’s a good candidate for an Agile approach.

- Estimation techniques: Planning Poker, Relative Sizing.
- Story points and velocity.
- Release planning and iteration planning.

### Development practices

- Test-driven development (TDD).
- Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD).
- Pair programming and code reviews.
- Retrospectives and process improvement.

### Scaling

- Some scaling frameworks (e.g., SAFe, LeSS, Nexus).
- Challenges in scaling Agile.
- Agile at the portfolio level.
