## What is scrum

![Scum](/assets/images/collection/scum.png)

Scrum is an **empirical process**, where decisions are based on observation, experience and experimentation. Scrum has three pillars: **transparency**, **inspection** and **adaptation**.

The **Scrum values** of **Courage**, **Focus**, **Commitment**, **Respect**, and **Openness** binding all of the elements together is **Trust**.

### Some benefits

- **Flexibility** allows teams to adapt to changing requirements and priorities.
- **Transparency** promotes transparency at all levels. This enables the team to incorporate customer feedback early and often, leading to higher customer satisfaction.
- **Early delivery of value** increases in short iterations.
- **Predictability** provides a predictable rhythm with its fixed-duration sprints.

### Some drawbacks

- **Rigidity** for some projects can be limit projects that require more flexible timelines.
- **Inaccurate initial estimates** makes the effort required for each item can be challenging, leading to inaccurate predictions for sprint outcomes.
- **Overemphasis on meetings** can become time-consuming if not managed efficiently, potentially taking away from productive development time.
- **Risk of burnout** can sometimes lead to burnout among team members if not properly managed.

## Sprint

### Sprint point

To estimate the amount of effort it will take to complete an item in the backlog.

Some methods to calculate point of tasks:

- Linear: 1 (extra small), 2 (small), 3 (medium), 4 (large), 5 (extra large).
- Powers of 2: 1, 2, 4, 16, ...
- Fibonacci: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...

**Note**: a task which high points should be splitted into multiple smaller tasks.

### Daily standup

The developer team should to talk around three questions:

- What did you do yesterday to help to achieve the Sprint Goal?
- What will you do today?
- What prevent us from achieving the Sprint Goal?

### Sprint review

To get feedbacks from main stakeholder and analyze what to do next sprint.

### Sprint retrospective

To reflect on what went well and what could be improved for their next sprint.
